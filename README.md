## Description 
  
  *Why, What, and How:* 
  
  The cannabis industry has a lot of potential to help people suffering from epilepsy, PTSD, chronic pain, weight gain, cancer, depression, seizures, anxiety, glaucoma, the list goes on and on. Life can be very forgetful but, it doesn't have to be. Our app includes a personalized cannabis diary, which allows both medical and recreational users to rate the cannabis they're currently consuming. 

In this personalized cannabis diary, users are also able to leave themselves comments about the medicine they found, where and why it works best for them; as well as notes on things they may like about it. This allows the user to seek out and fine tune the strains that work best for them. The users will also be able to save and view their comments for later use. 

Just want to have fun recreationally? 
Private Reserve gives people a place to keep their thoughts to themselves, Now you don’t have to worry about bosses, families or employers. We believe that not everything needs to be public knowledge to things like Facebook or Yelp.
